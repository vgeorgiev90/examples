# MySQL Resources

Resources included:
* MySQL User which will be used with AWS IAM based authentication
* Grants for the mysql user on the application database

Notes:
As the RDS is deployed inside private subnets this module depends on the bastion host and its SOCKS5 proxy setup
TODO:
Include more databases/users if needed.
